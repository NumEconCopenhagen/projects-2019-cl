# Dataproject
## Assignment 1: Criminal offences in Denmark 2007-2018.
In this project, we extract data of criminal offences in Denmark from Statistics Denmark using their API. The dataset covers the period 2007-2018 and contains observations on different administrative levels and different types of criminal offences. In the project, we structure and clean the data in order to make different sorts of descriptive statistics. In particular, we describe the development in the total number of reported offences on the country level and then continue by uncovering different forms of heterogeneity across regions, municipalities, types of criminal offences and reported vs. charged offences.

### Prerequisites:
In the project we construct a choropleth using a shape file containing geographical data of Danish municipalities. To do this, you have to install geopandas. Installing geopandas can be cumbersome on windows, however, we succeeded when following the instructions on:

and

Should contain a short introduction to your project, and show how to produce your results.
