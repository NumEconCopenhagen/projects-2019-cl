# Modelproject

In this model project, we present the koopmans model, also known as the Robinson Crusoe Economy. The model is analyzed and solved using sympy.

We first optimize within the producer market by maximizing the reduced problem - plugging the constraint into the profit function. We then optimize within the consumer market using sympy's version of a lagrange constrained optimizer. 

The optimal wage as a function of the consumption price is found and we show that markets clear with supply and demand equalized of both labor and the consumption good.

The solution is visualized.
